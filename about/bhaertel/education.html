				<h3>CSS 342 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics I</h3>
				<p>Integrating mathematical principles with detailed instruction in computer programming. Explores mathematical reasoning and discrete structures through object-oriented programming. Includes algorithm analysis, basic abstract data types, and data structures.</p>
				
				<h3>CSS 343 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics II</h3>
				<p>Develops competencies associated with problem-solving, algorithms, and computational models. Covers abstract data types and data structures, efficiency of algorithms, binary tree representations and traversals, searching, dictionaries, priority queues, hashing, directed graphs and graph algorithms, and language grammars </p>
				
				<h3>CSS 350 Management Principles for Computing Professionals</h3>
				<p>Through a team software project, explores critical interpersonal, communication, leadership, decision-making, social, and cultural theories drawn from contemporary research in anthropology, sociology, psychology, and business. </p>
				
				<h3>CSS 360 Software Engineering</h3>
				<p>Surveys the software engineering processes, tools, and techniques used in software development and quality assurance. Topics include life-cycle models, process modeling, requirements analysis and specification techniques, quality assurance techniques, verification and validation, testing, project planning, and management.</p>
				
				<h3>CSS 370 Analysis and Design (5)</h3>
				<p>Methods and tools to capture and communicate requirements, proposed solutions, and design to management, customers, and software developers. Data, process, and object modeling using languages such as data flow diagrams, entity/relationship diagrams, and unified modeling language use cases and class and sequence diagrams. </p>
				
				<h3>CSS 385 Introduction to Game Development</h3>
				<p>Examines the fundamental issues in designing and developing computer video games; creative and artistic elements, story narration, software architecture, interaction model, mathematic, physics, special effects, and in-game AI logic. Experiences elements in game design: world setting, game play, and interface; and experiences implementing games: conceptualization, prototyping, and play testing. </p>
				
				<h3>CSS 390 Interactions on Mobile Devices </h3>
				<p>This class examines application development on mobile devices in the context of programming with graphical user interaction tools, hardware sensors, and web-services. The class builds on studentsâ€™ knowledge from data structures and begins with introducing software development environments and models, follows by iterating through programming concepts required to work with input devices and sensors found on most mobile devices, and covers the fundamentals of programming with existing web-services. This will be a hands-on class where students will build applications during and after each lecture to practice the concepts learned. </p>
				
				<h3>CSS 422 Hardware and Computer Organization</h3>
				<p>An introduction to the architecture, operation, and organization of a modern computing machine. Topics covered include basic logic operations, state-machines, register models, memory organization, peripherals, and system issues. Assembly language taught in order to understand the instruction set architecture and memory model of the computer.</p>
				
				<h3>CSS 430 Operating Systems (5)</h3>
				<p>Principles of operating systems, including process management, memory management, auxiliary storage management, and resource allocation. Focus on the structure of the popular desktop and real-time operating systems.</p>
				
				<h3>CSS 475 Database Systems</h3>
				<p>Methods for obtaining requirements and designing database systems; differences between hierarchical, relational, and network database designs; techniques for designing and coding effective reporting procedures.</p>
				
				<h3>STMATH 308 Matrix Algebra with Applications</h3>
				<p>Introduces linear algebra, including systems of linear equations, Gaussian elimination, matrices and matrix algebra, vector spaces, subspaces of Euclidean space, linear independence, bases and dimension, orthogonality, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues.
